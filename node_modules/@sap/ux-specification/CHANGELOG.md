## [1.120.6] - 2024-03-07

### Added

- New API functions exportConfigEntityByPath and deleteConfigEntityByPath have been added that allow a selective export or deletion of a single property or section from a config.json. The additional parameter entityPath must be applied. The new functions are released for List Report, Object Page and Analytical List Page of OData V2 and V4.
- In the API result a change indicator is added that shows if the manifest was changed. In case of the new functions exportConfigEntityByPath and deleteConfigEntityByPath, only updated fragment files are returned (V2 flexibility changes are still returned completely due to compatibility, deletion is indicated by newValue = null).

### Quality

- Update transitive dependencies

Upgrades

- eslint to 8.56.0
- esbuild to 0.19.11
- reflect-metadata to 0.2.1
- axios to 1.6.5
- @sapui5/ts-types-esm to 1.120.4

## [1.120.1] - 2023-11-30

### Added

- OData V2: Added missing `annotationPath` property for table definitions in schema

### Changed

- OVP card settings:
  - Added missing properties
  - Removed irrelevant settings from custom card settings
  - Assignment of settings to card types has been generally aligned with the given capabilities of SAP Fiori elements

- If problems had been posted to the log with regards to annotations, they normally ended with the information `location: webapp/localService/metadata.xml`. This location information might be misleading for edmx projects, as annotation may reside in a different file. It was always wrong for CAP projects.
Thus the location information is removed for annotation problems

- If no line item annotation is present, no `annotationPath` property gets added to the schemas of OData V2 and V4
  
### Removed

### Deprecated

### Fixed

- The check of minUI5Version against the dist tags raised wrong warnings in case of minUI5Version using the pattern 'UI5-xxx'
- OData V4: Inconsistencies in the JSON schema for macros led to exceptions when generating the overall page schemas. Such exceptions are now caught and indicated in the error log

### Added

  - Added support for TreeTable

### Changed
  
### Removed

### Deprecated

### Fixed

- Fixed an exception "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')" when generating the app schemas

- OData V4:
  - If multiple facets refer to target annotations without an ID but with identical labels, only one of the facets was shown in the page editor
  - An error message was added to the logger if the ID was missing for a reference facet. This was wrong, the ID is optional for reference facets. Instead, the error message is now added for missing IDs of collection facets
  - Building blocks:
    - The number of new lines that get created from the description of building block properties was decreased
    - Missing 'enum' for multiple building block properties
